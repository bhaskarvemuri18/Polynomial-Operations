# Polynomial-Operations

A custom list in Java was built which represents a polynomial. The list offers operations on the polynomials as follows:

- Addition of a term to the polynomial
- Retrieve the degree of the polynomial
- Evaluate the polynomial by taking in a value 
- Add two polynomial lists
- Find the derivative of the polynomial 

Each polynomial term in the list would be represented as a single node and the entire list was designed in such a way that it would utilize the recursive union mechanism in order to perform any operations on the list.
